### Hi there 👋

I am a senior business consultant who was fascinated with the world of programming and I have decided to start a new challenge in my professional life.

I am currently learning web development, I want to start offering global and digital business solutions to my clients, and with this I add unique and exceptional value to my current service offering.

Join me if you want to collaborate, I’m always looking for help
